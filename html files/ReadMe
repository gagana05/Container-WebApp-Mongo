OBJECTIVE:
Deploy a web application with a NoSQL (MongoDB) backend on two different
containers, to ensure proper communication between them using suitable mechanisms.

PROCEDURE AND CONFIGURATION:
• Created a new resource group that is used to hold all
resources for the assignment.
• Created a new virtual network (Virtual-Network-1) to host the VMs required, the IP
range for this Virtual Network is 10.0.0.0/16. Also, a default subnet was created.
• Create a new a Virtual Machine (VM) and attach it to the above subnet. The
following is the VM configuration: (not necessary to follow the same).
	o OS image: Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS – Gen1
	o Size: Standard B1ms– 1vCPU, 2GiB Memory
	o Allowed public inbound ports: 22(SSH), 80(HTTP), 443(HTTPS)
	o Public IP: VM-1-ip (13.68.130.186)
	o Private IP: 10.0.0.6

• Now to configure the VM to host the web application. SSH into the VM and perform
the following steps
	o Install docker:

		sudo apt install docker.io

	o Install container with apache-php:
	
		docker run -tid -p 80:80 --name apache_server php:7-apache

	o Create the required .php files to run the web application after exec into docker container.
	o Install MongoDB driver in apache_server container and other configurations:

		pecl install mongodb

• Create another Virtual Machine (VM-Mongo) by following the same steps as VM but
replacing VM to VM-Mongo as required.
	o Public IP: VM-Mongo-ip (20.55.40.30)
	o Private IP: 10.0.0.4
	o Allowed public inbound ports: 22(SSH), 27017(Port_MongoDocker)

• Now to configure the VM-Mongo to host MongoDB. SSH into the VM and perform
the following steps.
	o Install docker:

sudo apt install docker.io

	o Install container with MongoDB:
		docker run -it -v mongodata:/data/db -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb -d mongo
	o Create new database (ImageDB) for storing the image metadata.

LOGIN/SSH DETAILS:
• The web application is created with guest and admin login
	o Use guest as username and password under GUEST USER.
• The two VM’s created can be connected using SSH for verification.
	o Use root as username and password as mentioned below
		▪ ssh root@13.68.130.186
		▪ To view docker container apache_server

			docker exec -it apache_server bash

		▪ ssh root@20.55.40.30
		▪ To view docker container mongodb

			docker exec -it mongodb bash
			
NOTE:
The configuration and IP details are just given for reference.
